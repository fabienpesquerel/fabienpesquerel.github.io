I am interested in the problem of **sequential learning** in which an agent interacts with an environment in order to achieve a goal. The agent must **adapt to the information** obtained from its observations. The sequential processing of information make this problem a difficult and interesting one, in particular when applied to machine translation, recommender systems, physics, or even cybersecurity.

**What makes such problems interesting to me is that you learn about the problem you want to solve as you solve it!**
    
I am as motivated by the **mathematical and computational aspects of the problem** (*What is an optimal strategy/decision?*) than I am by the **modelling** aspects (*How can we model a human decision-making? How to model and incroporate expert knowledge?*).

Outside of work, I really enjoy cooking and doing calisthenics. I have a blog <a href='https://analysthenics.github.io/'>Analy**Sthenics**</a> that is mainly dedicated to the analysis of calisthenics and gymnastics data.
