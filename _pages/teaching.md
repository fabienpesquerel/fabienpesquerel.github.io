I am currently not teaching any class.

In the past, I taught about Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Operating Systems, and mathematics in general.

I have also been teaching to health professional (mainly urgentist and radiologist) working at a French hospital about Machine Learning.

If you want to hire me to teach about Machine Learning in your company (in French or English), please send me an e-mail!
